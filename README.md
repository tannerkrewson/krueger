_Chris Hodges, you're a fool._

_You're also... dressin' like a tool._

_I'm tired of you're face, walkin' in the crowd,_

_Embarrassing me, and bein' a disgrace._

_YEAH! You try to play horn, but you fail,_

_And everybody knows that you just wail!_

_And I'm tired of this crap, yeah._

_So I'm going to beat you, all day._
